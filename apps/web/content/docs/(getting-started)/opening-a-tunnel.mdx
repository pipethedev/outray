Once you are authenticated, you can start exposing your local services to the internet.

## Basic Usage

To expose a local server running on a specific port (e.g., 3000), simply run:

```bash
outray 3000
```

You will see an output similar to this:

```bash
✨ Connecting to OutRay...
🔌 Linked to your local port 3000
🌐 Tunnel ready: https://random-name.tunnel.outray.app
🥹 Don't close this or I'll cry softly.
```

Now, anyone with the public URL can access your local server.

## Inspecting Traffic

OutRay provides a real-time view of requests and responses in your terminal. As requests come in, you will see the method, path, and status code.

## Stopping the Tunnel

To stop the tunnel, simply press `Ctrl+C` in your terminal. This will close the connection and the public URL will no longer be accessible.
