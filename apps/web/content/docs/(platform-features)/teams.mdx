OutRay is built for collaboration. You can create organizations and invite team members to share resources.

## Features

- **Shared Domains**: Any domain added to an organization is available to all members.
- **Centralized Billing**: Manage subscriptions for your entire team in one place.
- **Role-Based Access**: Control who can manage domains and billing.

## Switching Organizations

If you belong to multiple organizations, you can switch between them using the CLI.

### Interactive Switch

Run the following command to see a list of your organizations and select one:

```bash
outray switch
```

### Direct Switch

If you know the slug of the organization you want to switch to, you can pass it directly:

```bash
outray switch my-org-slug
```

### Per-Command Override

You can also override the active organization for a single command using the `--org` flag:

```bash
outray 3000 --org my-other-org
```
