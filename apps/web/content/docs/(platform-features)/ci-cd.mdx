OutRay is perfect for preview environments in CI/CD pipelines. By using API keys, you can automate tunnel creation without interactive login.

## Setup

1.  **Generate API Key**: Go to your organization settings in the dashboard and generate a new API Key.
2.  **Store Secret**: Store the API key as a secret in your CI provider (e.g., `OUTRAY_API_KEY`).

## Usage

Use the `--key` flag to authenticate the tunnel:

```bash
outray 3000 --key $OUTRAY_API_KEY
```

## Example: GitHub Actions

Here is a simple example of how to use OutRay in a GitHub Action:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Start Tunnel
    run: |
      npm install -g outray
      outray 3000 --key ${{ secrets.OUTRAY_API_KEY }} &
```
