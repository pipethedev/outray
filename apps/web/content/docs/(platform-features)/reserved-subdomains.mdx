By default, OutRay assigns a random subdomain to your tunnel each time you start it. However, for many use cases (like webhooks or OAuth callbacks), you need a consistent URL.

## Usage

You can request a specific subdomain using the `--subdomain` flag:

```bash
outray 3000 --subdomain my-app
```

If the subdomain is available, your public URL will be `https://my-app.tunnel.outray.app`.

## Reservation

Subdomains are reserved for your organization. Once you successfully use a subdomain, it is linked to your organization, and no other user can claim it.
