OutRay is a fast, secure, and open-source tunnel application that allows you to share your local sites and applications with others on the internet. It serves as a modern alternative to tools like ngrok, designed specifically for developers who value performance and control.

## Why OutRay?

- **Open Source**: The core of OutRay is open source, giving you the freedom to inspect, modify, and self-host the entire stack.
- **Fast & Secure**: Built with performance in mind, OutRay ensures your tunnels are stable and secure.
- **Developer Friendly**: A powerful CLI and intuitive dashboard make managing your tunnels a breeze.

## How it works

OutRay creates a secure tunnel between your local machine and the OutRay edge network. When someone visits your public URL, the request is forwarded through the tunnel to your local server, and the response is sent back to the visitor.
