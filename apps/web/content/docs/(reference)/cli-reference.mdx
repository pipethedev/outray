The OutRay CLI is your primary tool for interacting with the OutRay network. This reference covers all available commands and flags.

## Commands

### `outray login`

Initiates the authentication process. This command opens your default browser to the OutRay dashboard where you can authorize the CLI.

```bash
outray login
```

Once authenticated, your session token is stored locally in your configuration file.

### `outray <port>`

Starts a tunnel for the specified local port. This is the most common command you will use.

```bash
outray 3000
```

**Arguments:**

- `port`: The local port number you want to expose (e.g., `3000`, `8080`).

**Options:**

- `--subdomain <name>`: Request a specific subdomain.
- `--domain <domain>`: Use a custom domain.
- `--org <slug>`: Run the tunnel under a specific organization.
- `--key <token>`: Use a specific API key instead of the logged-in user.

### `outray switch`

Switch between organizations. If you belong to multiple organizations, you can use this command to change your active context.

```bash
# Interactive selection
outray switch

# Direct switch
outray switch my-org-slug
```

### `outray whoami`

Displays information about the currently authenticated user and the active organization.

```bash
outray whoami
```

### `outray logout`

Clears the local authentication credentials.

```bash
outray logout
```
